# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to
agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,
and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit
https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the
instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/)
or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

## Contributing Code

We encourage contributions such as bug fixes, DirectML kernels, or general performance and stability improvements. For more substantial changes, we ask that you reach out first with GitHub issues or by contacting us directly at askdirectml@microsoft.com. This project's focus is currently on improving functional and performance parity with the official CUDA backend, so unrelated changes are less likely to be approved.

Before creating a pull request, make sure to format your change in accordance with TensorFlow's coding style (see below).

### C++ coding style

Changes to TensorFlow C++ code should conform to
[Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

Use `clang-tidy` to check your C/C++ changes. To install `clang-tidy` on ubuntu:16.04, do:

```bash
apt-get install -y clang-tidy
```

You can check a C/C++ file by doing:


```bash
clang-format <my_cc_file> --style=google > /tmp/my_cc_file.cc
diff <my_cc_file> /tmp/my_cc_file.cc
```

### Formatting all files

To automatically format all files in the repository and make sure that they conform to the guidelines, run `format.sh` on Ubuntu or `format.ps1` on Windows.
